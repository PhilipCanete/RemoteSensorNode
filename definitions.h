//Anemometer Technical Variables
//The following variables correspond to the anemometer sold by Adafruit, but could be modified to fit other anemometers.

const int sensorPin = A0; //Defines the pin that the anemometer output is connected to

float voltageConversionConstant = .004882814; //This constant maps the value provided from the analog read function, which ranges from 0 to 1023, to actual voltage, which ranges from 0V to 5V
int sensorDelay = 1000; //Delay between sensor readings, measured in milliseconds (ms)

float voltageMin = .4; // Mininum output voltage from anemometer in mV.
float windSpeedMin = 0; // Wind speed in meters/sec corresponding to minimum voltage

float voltageMax = 2.0; // Maximum output voltage from anemometer in mV.
float windSpeedMax = 32; // Wind speed in meters/sec corresponding to maximum voltage

//Temp and Humidity sensor variables
// Connect RED of the AM2315 sensor to 5.0V
// Connect BLACK to Ground
// Connect WHITE to i2c clock - on '168/'328 Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/etc thats Analog 5
// Connect YELLOW to i2c data - on '168/'328 Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/etc thats Analog 4
